# Neurodog

Treehacks 2024 Hackathon Submission


Neurodog (https://lnkd.in/dFhTEbkG), A robotic companion engineered to interpret brainwave patterns, which triggers commands to offer emotional support and medical aid without the requirement of managing a traditional service animal.

Neurodog recognizes familiar brainwave patterns using the Neurosity Crown, including emotional states like "sadness," and automatically executes corresponding commands to provide comfort and assistance to its user. By merging OpenAI with voice commands we were able to implement into Neurodog to recognize natural language voice promptsâ€” providing a more realistic feel while extending the range of voice functionalities available. Neurodog uses the SPOT dog by Boston Dynamics to imitate the actions of a service animal for our project.
